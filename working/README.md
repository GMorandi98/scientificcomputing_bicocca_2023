# Excercises solved by Gabriele Morandi:

- L01: Q6 and Q8.
- L02: Q5 and Q6. 
- L03: Q3 and Q8.
- L04: Q2 and Q3.
- L05: all of them.
- L06: Q1 and Q2. 
- L07: Q1 and Q3.
- L08: Q1. 

Since I implemented both the code and the visual animation of the game of life of Lecture 3 I decided to skip one excercise of the final lecture (you gave us this oppurtunity during Lecture 2, if I correctly remember, otherwise contact me). 

Thank you very much for the beautiful and very usefull class.
